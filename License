I am pleased to share my code with the community under a license that strictly prohibits commercial use. This license ensures that the code is available solely for educational and research purposes, allowing students, educators, and researchers to utilize and build upon this work freely. By implementing this licensing model, I aim to foster an environment of learning and innovation while safeguarding the code from commercial exploitation. I encourage users to explore, experiment, and contribute to the development of this project, maintaining the spirit of open knowledge and collaboration.
